      Mali is a country in West Africa, known for its deserts, and its rich cultural history.
      A long time ago, it was part of the Mali Empire, one of the most powerful empires in Africa.
      In the 1300s, a famous king named Mansa Musa ruled the empire. He was known for being one of
      the richest people ever and helped make the city of Timbuktu a place of learning and trade.

      Later, in the late 1800s, France took control of Mali and made it part of French West Africa.
      Mali stayed a colony until 1960, when it became an independent country. At first, it was called
      the Sudanese Republic but soon changed its name to Mali to honor its great past.
